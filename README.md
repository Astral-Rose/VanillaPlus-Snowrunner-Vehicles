# Vanilla+ Vehicle Changes

**Hello there!**

This is a collection of all the changes I have been making to Snowrunner, from trucks to changing a couple tires and add-ons, it's all here.

I am trying to create a very "Vanilla+" kind of change to the game. I'm not trying to add in engines or add-ons or what not that do not exist in the base game, for the sake of keeping things simple enough to add or remove. Like I'm not going to add engines to the XML files in case an update removes the file and now the truck is trying to call an engine that does not exist (with one exception, see Azov Antactic below).

Basically, I'm doing things like adding mini cranes, maintenance add-ons, sideboard beds, or other add-ons to vehicles that do not have them. Or making slight tweaks to add-ons to give them a little more value (like more water capacity or some extra repair parts, things that won't break when going back to vanilla)

## How to install

All you need is Winrar. That's it. Wherever you have the Snowrunner game files install, open the preload/paks/client/initial.pak in Winrar, then drag the (unzipped) [Media] folder from your download location to the [Media] folder in Winrar, and accept the popup. It will replace all the files in the initial.pak with all the ones you downloaded.

Are there changes in here you don't like? Maybe you want the Ank tires to not ignore ice for example. Or maybe you just hate the Antarctic so much you don't want it to change at all. Just delete the file from the downloaded files before doing the steps above. Or dive into the initial.pak files in Winrar and drag and drop only the files you want to replace. The file structure within the initial.pak is the same as the one you downloaded.

## All changes that have been made:

**Twinsteer**
* Lowered center of gravity 
* Increased fuel tank capacity slightly, since it has 3 fuel tanks.

**Azov Antarctic** 

I will admit, the Azov Antarctic is probably one of my favorite trucks in the game, and I have a bit of a soft spot for it, so it's gotten the most love from me.
* Lowered the center of gravity
* Added an engine that doubles the horsepower of the stock top engine
  * This is the only engine I have added and will add. It's usable by all vehicles that share engines with the Azov Antarctic, so not using it on other vehicles is pretty much a self imposed rule. It's also only 200 credits, in case you lose the engine it's not a huge money loss
* Added Mini Crane, Maintenance Module, and Fuel Tank
  * NOTE: Mini Crane is bugged. The truck has to be straight in order for the crane to work properly, if the truck is articulated at all it will only work on one side of the vehicle
  * Mini crane will move to the back of the cargo beds if they are installed. While this looks fine with the sideboard bed, the flatbed has the mini crane floating just behind it. Nothing I can do about that, both beds share the same addon.
  * By the same token, the crane sits so high that the anchors will not reach the ground

**Kolobs**
* Added Long Log capacity to make them like Russian P16s

-----

**Tuz 166**
* Changed the rear spare tire add-on to also include some spare parts and 20 liters of fuel. Since the rear tire actually removes the hitch, it's a way to make it more worth taking, like you throw in a box of spare parts and a jerry can of fuel into the back seat.
  * This change is also because I don't like the look of the roof rack on the Tuz. I will admit the creation of this one was cosmetic bias on my part, as much sense as it actually makes to have.

-----

**Khan 317**
* Changed from Rear Wheel Drive to Front Wheel Drive, just like the real vehicle. Does this make the vehicle worse? I think so, but it's unique at least.

-----

**Cat 745C**
* Added Lift King Crane, Long Log carrier, sideboard and flatbed cargo holders, the unused water tank, and a trailer hitch
  * NOTE: I noticed the Lift King on the Cat is weaker than other truck's Lift Kings. Not enough to make it useless, but enough that I couldn't lift the TH357 with it onto a trailer.
* Changed the Medium logs in the log carrier to be shorter so it can be hitched with a medium logs carrier for two loads at once

-----

**Cat 770G**
* Increased turning response time
* Made it All Wheel Drive (since the real one can crush rocks in it's way with it's weight and the rocks in Snowrunner are stronger than unobtainium, this is the next best thing)
* Gave it a high saddle

-----

**Dan 96320**
* Added a mini crane and changed the sideboard bed to the Zikz variant
* Removed the fuel visual from the battery box, as apparently someone confused the battery box as a secondary fuel tank. Still working on trying to remove the hitbox from this "fuel tank".

-----

**Kirovets tractors**
* Increased turn response time and angle

-----

**Derry Special**
* Increase fire tank capacity so it can hold double, to make up for not being able to tow a water trailer with it equipped.

-----

**Tires**
* Changed the model of the MSH III to the MSH I, and made it ignore ice. Makes those super big trucks a little more viable on iced over roads
* Changed the Ank MK38 tires to ignore ice. Incredibly short sighted that you have to give up the Ank's superb tires just to put chains on them in vanilla

I hope you enjoy these changes! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please feel free to bring them up! I can't promise I"ll have the time to add things but I'll take everything into consideration!
