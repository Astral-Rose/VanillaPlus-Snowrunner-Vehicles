# All changes that have been made:

**Twinsteer**
* Lowered center of gravity 
* Increased fuel tank capacity slightly, since it has 3 fuel tanks.

-----

**Azov Antarctic** 
* Lowered the center of gravity
* Added an engine that doubles the horsepower of the stock top engine
  * (The only engine I have added. It's usable by all vehicles that share engines with the Azov Antarctic, so not using it on other vehicles is pretty much a self imposed rule. It's also only 200 credits, in case you lose the engine it's not a huge money loss)
* Added Mini Crane, Maintenance Module, and Fuel Tank
  * NOTE: Mini Crane is bugged. The truck has to be straight in order for the crane to work properly, if the truck is articulated at all it will only work on one side of the vehicle

-----

**Kolobs**
* Added Long Log capacity to make them like Russian P16s

-----

**Tuz 166**
* Changed the rear spare tire to also include some spare parts and 20 liters of fuel. Since the rear tire actually removes the hitch, it's a way to make it more worth taking, like you throw in a box of spare parts and a jerry can of fuel into the back seat.

-----

**Khan 317**
* Changed from Rear Wheel Drive to Front Wheel Drive, just like the real vehicle

-----

**Cat 745C**
* Added Lift King Crane, Long Log carrier, sideboard and flatbed cargo holders, the unused water tank, and a trailer hitch
  * NOTE: I noticed the Lift King on the Cat is weaker than other truck's Lift Kings. Not enough to make it useless, but enough that I couldn't lift the TH357 with it onto a trailer.
* Changed the Medium logs in the log carrier to be shorter so it can be hitched with a medium logs carrier for two loads at once

-----

**Cat 770G**
* Increased turning response time
* Made it All Wheel Drive (since the real one can crush rocks in it's way with it's weight and the rocks in Snowrunner are stronger than unobtainium, this is the next best thing)
* Gave it a high saddle

-----

**Dan 96320**
* Added a mini crane and changed the sideboard bed to the Zikz variant

-----

**Kirovets tractors**
* Increased turn response time and angle

-----

**Derry Special**
* Increase fire tank capacity so it can hold double

-----

**Tires**
* Changed the model of the MSH III to the MSH I, and made it ignore ice. Makes those super big trucks a little more viable on iced over roads
* Changed the Ank MK38 tires to ignore ice. Incredibly short sighted that you have to give up the Ank's superb tires just to put chains on them in vanilla
